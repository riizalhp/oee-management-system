## How to?

If an error happened when try to run 'php artisan serve', try to :

1. run 'composer install'
2. then, try to run 'php artisan serve' again.

If 500 | server error happened, try to :

1. Look to .env files. If it still .env.example, rename it to .env
2. the, to try to run 'php artisan serve' again.

The web says that there is no application key?
try to run 'php artisan key:generate' then try to run the server again.
